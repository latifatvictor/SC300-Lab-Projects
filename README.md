# SC 300 Lab Projects
This repository contains my hands on projects, lab exercises and study notes from the Microsoft SC 300 Identity and Access Administrator learning path.

My goal is to build strong practical skills in Microsoft Entra ID, identity governance, Conditional Access and modern authentication. Every project in this repository has been completed using my own Microsoft 365 lab environment.

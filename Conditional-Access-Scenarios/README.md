# Conditional Access Scenarios

This section contains practical Conditional Access projects that I completed in my Microsoft Entra ID lab environment while studying for the SC 300 exam.

Each scenario includes:

• The purpose of the policy  
• Step by step configuration  
• Screenshots of the setup  
• Testing and results  
• Logs and findings  
• Lessons learned  

These scenarios demonstrate real world identity security and zero trust access control.
